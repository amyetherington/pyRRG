So the idea to improve and automate the star - galaxy classification is to 
learn what is a start and galaxy through the various different probes and then 
using the input data, learn what is a star and what is a galaxy

To do this, I will take the moments of a lot of objects from a ton of exposures
and run some moment measuring. From this I will then classify the stars to create a training set.

I will learn on this training set, using features, which will be the raw moments and combinations of the raw moments.
- Moments
- Size
- Magnitude
- Exposure depth
- RA
- DEC

Once learnt i should be able to transmit this to all future data sets.
With the idea that everytime someone uses the data set, it improves it.
