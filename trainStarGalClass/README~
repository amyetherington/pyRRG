So the idea to improve and automate the star - galaxy classification is to 
learn what is a start and galaxy through the various different probes and then 
using the input data, learn what is a star and what is a galaxy

To do this, I will take the moments of a lot of objects from a ton of exposures
and run some moment measuring. From this I will then classify the stars to create a training set.

I will learn on this training set, using features, which will be the raw moments and combinations of the raw moments.
- Moments
- Size
- Magnitude
- Exposure depth
- RA
- DEC

Once learnt i should be able to transmit this to all future data sets.
With the idea that everytime someone uses the data set, it improves it.

1. Generate training set
2. Learn training set
3. Test model
4. Implement auto-update
5. Merge with master


Notes
-----
So it seems that it works pretty well (0.8243876080691642)
if we use the standard features. 
['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS']
This model was saved as 
starGalaxyModelNoExpTime.pkl

Im going to try with exposure time of the image
This didnt seem to want to work, or at least it took far too long to
train so sack it off

I tried swapping out MAG_ISO and put in FLUX_AUTO
Score = 0.9747838616714697
<<<<<<< HEAD
modelName = starGalaxyModelFluxAuto.pkl

Random forests are doing a much better job and is much quicker 
so i have now altered so it does this now.
So the models now have 10 features 
names = ['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS',\
        'xxxx','yyyy','xyyy','xxyy','ell']
with 1000 decision trees. Taking ~200seconds to train.
With criterion 'entropy'
starGalaxyModelRFa.pkl

I will try it with the global features now (skymed, exp_time etc)
starGalaxyModelRFb.pkl
    includeNames = \
      ['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS',\
        'xxxx','yyyy','xyyy','xxyy','ell','skymed','exp_time','skysd']
This has an improved rating of 0.8845461095100865
Number of correct stars: 24/27
Number of correct galaxies: 4761/5399
Number of correct noise: 124/126
Classifier score is 0.88
With criterion 'entropy'

If i try with all the features then it takes
Time to fit classifier is 366.20 seconds
and the score is
0.8650936599423631
With criterion 'entropy'

Selective feature but generous. with 1000 trees still
 includeNames = \
      ['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS','FLUX_AUTO',\
        'xxxx','yyyy','xyyy','xxyy','xx','xy','yy','e1','e2','prob','ell','skymed','exp_time','skysd']
Number of correct stars: 24/27
Number of correct galaxies: 4773/5399
Number of correct noise: 124/126
Classifier score is 0.89
With criterion 'entropy'
starGalaxyModelRF_20features_1000.pkl

Trees: 100

namesNoErr = \
      ['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS','FLUX_AUTO',\
       'exp_time','skysd']
Not worth it

Or any less features. Seems like more the better...


1. Larger training set required
=======
I have improved the training set by using all the clash clusters
The results are
Number of correct stars: 18/27
Number of correct galaxies: 4943/5399
Number of correct noise: 120/126
Classifier score is 0.92
So much better at the galaxies but not noise nor stars. So now i will increase number trees

Over the entire CLASH clusters, 20 features
100 trees
Number of correct stars: 795/1076
Number of correct galaxies: 84792/86284
Number of correct noise: 9784/18084
Classifier score is 0.90

1000 Trees
Number of correct stars: 795/1076
Number of correct galaxies: 84882/86284
Number of correct noise: 9790/18084
Classifier score is 0.91

1000 Trees
1998/9510 removed due to nans
Number of correct stars: 38/73
Number of correct galaxies: 11207/11313
Number of correct noise: 1195/1678
Classifier score is 0.95
But not including the GAL-*


Including GAL-* doesnt seem to make a difference
I think this is because there are so many objects in the CLASH clsuters
that it dominates the trees, so 
Number of correct stars: 38/73
Number of correct galaxies: 11207/11313
Number of correct noise: 1195/1678
Classifier score is 0.95

Number of correct stars: 38/73
