So the idea to improve and automate the star - galaxy classification is to 
learn what is a start and galaxy through the various different probes and then 
using the input data, learn what is a star and what is a galaxy

To do this, I will take the moments of a lot of objects from a ton of exposures
and run some moment measuring. From this I will then classify the stars to create a training set.

I will learn on this training set, using features, which will be the raw moments and combinations of the raw moments.
- Moments
- Size
- Magnitude
- Exposure depth
- RA
- DEC

Once learnt i should be able to transmit this to all future data sets.
With the idea that everytime someone uses the data set, it improves it.

1. Generate training set
2. Learn training set
3. Test model
4. Implement auto-update
5. Merge with master


Notes
-----
So it seems that it works pretty well (0.8243876080691642)
if we use the standard features. 
['MAG_AUTO','gal_size','MU_MAX','MAG_ISO','RADIUS']
This model was saved as 
starGalaxyModelNoExpTime.pkl

Im going to try with exposure time of the image
This didnt seem to want to work, or at least it took far too long to
train so sack it off

I tried swapping out MAG_ISO and put in FLUX_AUTO
Score = 0.9747838616714697
modelName = starGalaxyModelFluxAuto.pkl
