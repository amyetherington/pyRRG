    Given that source extration is a difficult thing for the photometry
    I will use the Mathilde mehtod, in Python to do a wrapper

    The process is the same as in mathilde_setract.pro
    THe weight file is optional however should be used.
    zero_point is the zero point of the iamge, if not used, it
    will guess it from the header of the file and assume it is ACS

    This will run two runs of sextractor, cold and hot, where cold only finds
    big things and hot finds small things

    Then it combines the two catalogues
